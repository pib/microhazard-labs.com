## Another blog? Yes. 


While I already have a blog over at [Probably Programming][probprog],
it just didn't feel right to start blogging about non-programming
projects there. It turns out that I have lots of non-programming
projects, so here we are.

Also, I have been meaning to play with [GitHub Pages][pages] as a
means of publishing a blog/website, so here I am. So far I am pleased
with Jekyll and how things are arranged and configured. Even though
I'm a Python guy, I am not above using a Ruby project if it gets the
job done.

## What to expect

I have several electronics projects I am working on and so far their
progress has gone un-documented, save for some posts on the [ATX
Hackerspace][atxhs] mailing lists. I plan on posting more thorough
project logs here and hopefully (eventually) set up a web store to
sell the results of some of the projects.

I'm not really sure how to handle projects which involve
microcontrollers, because those will have both electronics and
programming. Perhaps just splitting it into two posts? One about the
programming and one about the electronics? Does that make sense? Or
does it just make sense to keep it in one place? I'm not sure, but I'm
sure I'll figure it out at some point.
